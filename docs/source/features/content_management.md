# Content Management

Bedrock Server Manager allows you to easily manage the content of your server, including uploading new worlds and installing addons (resource and behavior packs).

## World Management

You can import existing worlds, export your current world, or reset the server to a fresh state.

### Importing a World

To use a custom world (e.g., a downloaded map or a backup from another server):

1.  **Upload the World**:
    *   Place your world file (`.mcworld`) into the `content/worlds` directory on the server.
    *   (Enable the content uploader plugin to easily upload content files).
2.  Select the server from the dropdown menu in the web dashboard.
3.  Navigate to the **Content** page and then click on the **Worlds** tab.
4.  Locate the file in the file list.
5.  Click the **Install** button next to the file.
6.  **Warning**: This action will replace the currently active world on the server. Ensure you have backed up your current world if you wish to save it.

### Exporting the Current World

To save a copy of your current world for download or transfer:

1.  Select the server from the dropdown menu in the web dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **Content** page and then click on the **Worlds** tab.
3.  Click the **Export World** button.
4.  BSM will compress the active world directory into a `.mcworld` file.
5.  The file will be exported to the `content/worlds` directory for you to import into another server.

### Resetting the World

To start fresh with a newly generated world:

1.  Select the server from the dropdown menu in the web dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **Content** page and then click on the **Worlds** tab.
3.  Click the **Reset World** button.
4.  Confirm the action.
5.  BSM will delete the current `worlds/` directory.
6.  Upon the next server start, the Bedrock Dedicated Server software will generate a new world based on the `level-seed` defined in `server.properties`.

## Addons (Resource & Behavior Packs)

BSM simplifies the process of installing, managing, and configuring addons to enhance your server.

### Installing Addons

1.  **Upload the Addon**:
    *   Place your addon file (`.mcpack`/`.mcaddon`) into the `content/addons` directory.
    *   (Enable the content uploader plugin to easily upload content files).
2.  Select the server from the dropdown menu in the web dashboard.
3.  Navigate to the **Content** page and then click on the **Addons** tab.
4.  Locate the file in the **Available Addons** list.
5.  Click the **Install** button.

### Managing Installed Addons

Once addons are installed, you can manage their status and load order:

1.  Navigate to the **Content** page and click the **Manage Installed Addons** button.
2.  A window will appear with tabs for **Behavior Packs** and **Resource Packs**.
3.  **Enabling/Disabling**: You can toggle addons on or off. Disabled addons remain installed on the server but are temporarily deactivated in the world configuration.
4.  **Reordering**: You can drag and drop the packs to change their load order (packs higher in the list load first and take priority over those below them). Click **Save Order** to apply the changes.
5.  **Removing**: You can click the delete/remove icon next to an installed pack to permanently remove it from the server.

### How It Works

When you install an addon, BSM performs the following actions:
1.  **Extraction**: Unzips the package.
2.  **Placement**: Moves resource packs to `resource_packs/` and behavior packs to `behavior_packs/`.
3.  **Activation**: Automatically updates `world_behavior_packs.json` and `world_resource_packs.json` to register the new content with the server.
