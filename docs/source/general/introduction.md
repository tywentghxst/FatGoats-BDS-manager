## Quick Start Guide

Bedrock Server Manager is also available as a docker image. See the [Docker Guide](../extras/docker.md) for more information.

### Step 1: Installation

```{note}
This app requires **Python 3.11** or later, and you will need **pip** installed.
```

First, install the main application package from PyPI:
```bash
pip install --upgrade bedrock-server-manager
```

#### (Optional) Install the API Client for CLI Management

To manage your servers from the command line, install the optional API client:
```bash
pip install --upgrade "bsm-api-client[cli]"
```
This provides the `bsm-api-client` command, which allows you to perform various tasks via the API.

> See the [Installation Guide](../extras/installation.md) for beta or development versions.

### Step 2: Configure the Web Server

To get started with the web server, its recommended to run the setup command first:

```bash
bedrock-server-manager setup
```

This command will prompt you for the necessary configuration details, such as:

-   **Data Directory**: The location where the application will store its data (default is `$HOME/bedrock-server-manager`).
-   **Databse URL**: The URL for the database connection (default is `sqlite:///<data_dir>/bedrock_server_manager.db`).
-   **Host**: The IP address the web server will listen on (default is `127.0.0.1`).
-   **Port**: The port the web server will use (default is `11325`).
-   **System Service**: Whether to install the web server as a system service (default is `no`).

If you choose not to run the setup command, default values will be used. This can be changed later by running the setup command.

### Step 3: Run the Application

To start the web server, use the following command:

```bash
bedrock-server-manager web start
```
By default, the server listens on `127.0.0.1:11325`. Once running, you can access the web interface in your browser at this address.

Once the server is running, a one first-time setup will be required. This includes setting up an admin user account and configuring your first bedrock server.

> See the [Web Usage Guide](../web/general.md) for more examples, like how to run the server on a different IP.
