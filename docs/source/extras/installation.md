There are three ways to install Bedrock Server Manager, depending on your needs. For most users, the stable version is recommended.

---

## 1. Stable Version (Recommended)

This is the latest official, stable release. It has been tested and is suitable for most use cases. This command will install or upgrade to the latest stable version available on PyPI (Python Package Index).

```bash
pip install --upgrade bedrock-server-manager
```

**Installing a Specific Version**

If you need to install a specific version, you can do so by specifying the version with `==`.

```bash
# Example: Install exactly version 3.2.5
pip install bedrock-server-manager==3.2.5
```

You can find a list of all available versions in the [**Release History on PyPI**](https://pypi.org/project/bedrock-server-manager/#history).

---

## 2. Beta / Pre-Release Versions (For Testers)

Occasionally, pre-release versions will be published to PyPI for testing. These versions contain new features and are generally stable but may contain minor bugs.

To install the latest pre-release version, use the `--pre` flag with pip:

```bash
pip install --pre bedrock-server-manager
```

If you wish to return to the stable version later, you can run:
`pip install --force-reinstall bedrock-server-manager`

**Previewing the Next Release**

The `dev` branch is where all beta developments are merged before being bundled into a new stable release. To see the latest changes that are being prepared, you can browse the code and documentation on the [**`dev` branch**](https://github.com/DMedina559/bedrock-server-manager/tree/dev).

## 3. Advanced Installation (For Developers & Contributors)

These instructions are for advanced users who want to run the absolute latest code or contribute to the project. Since the project includes a compiled frontend, you cannot simply install directly from the git URL anymore.

**Prerequisites:**
*   **Python:** Version 3.11 or higher.
*   **Node.js:** Version 20 or higher (required for building the frontend).
*   **Git:** To clone the repository.

**Step-by-Step Build & Install:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DMedina559/bedrock-server-manager.git
    cd bedrock-server-manager
    ```

2.  **Checkout the Desired Branch:**
    *   `main`: Stable code.
    *   `dev`: Latest features and changes (unstable).
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    ```

3.  **Build the Project:**
    The project uses a build script to compile the frontend assets (React/JS) and prepare the Python package.

    *   **Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        chmod +x build.sh
        ./build.sh
        ```
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bat
        build.bat
        ```

    This process will:
    *   Install npm dependencies in `frontend/`.
    *   Build the static assets to `src/bedrock_server_manager/web/static/js/dist/`.
    *   Build the Python package using `build`.

4.  **Install the Local Package:**
    Once built, you can install the package in editable mode (recommended for development) or as a standard package.

    ```bash
    # Editable install (changes to python code reflect immediately)
    pip install -e .

    # OR Standard install
    pip install .
    ```

**Note on Versioning:**
The project uses `setuptools-scm` for dynamic versioning. The version number is automatically derived from the latest git tag. If you are working on a purely local copy without git metadata, you may need to set the `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION` environment variable during build.

## 4. Environment Variables

You can configure the application using environment variables. These variables take precedence over the configuration file.

*   `BSM_DATA_DIR`: Overrides the default directory where the application stores data (servers, backups, etc.).
*   `BSM_DB_URL`: Overrides the database connection URL found in the configuration file.

## 5. Database Configuration

Bedrock Server Manager uses SQLAlchemy to connect to a database. By default, it uses a SQLite database, but you can configure it to use other databases like MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL.

To use a different database, you need to:
1.  Install the necessary database driver.
2.  Set the `db_url` in your configuration file OR set the `BSM_DB_URL` environment variable to the correct database connection string.

### Installing Database Drivers

You can install the required drivers as optional dependencies with `pip`.

*   **For MySQL:**
    ```bash
    pip install "bedrock-server-manager[mysql]"
    ```
    This will install both `mysqlclient` and `PyMySQL`.

*   **For MariaDB:**
    ```bash
    pip install "bedrock-server-manager[mariadb]"
    ```
    This will install both `mariadb` and `PyMySQL`.

*   **For PostgreSQL:**
    ```bash
    pip install "bedrock-server-manager[postgresql]"
    ```
    This will install `psycopg`.

### Database Connection URLs

Here are some examples of connection URLs for different databases.

*   **MySQL (using `mysqlclient`):**
    ```
    mysql://user:password@host/dbname
    ```

*   **MySQL (using `PyMySQL`):**
    ```
    mysql+pymysql://user:password@host/dbname
    ```

*   **MariaDB (using `mariadb`):**
    ```
    mariadb://user:password@host/dbname
    ```

*   **MariaDB (using `PyMySQL`):**
    ```
    mariadb+pymysql://user:password@host/dbname
    ```

*   **PostgreSQL (using `psycopg`):**
    ```
    postgresql+psycopg://user:password@host/dbname
    ```
