# bedrock_server_manager/plugins/api_bridge.py
"""A bridge to safely expose core application APIs to plugins.

This module provides a critical decoupling mechanism for the plugin system.
Instead of plugins importing API functions directly (which would create
circular dependencies and tight coupling), the core application's API modules
register their callable functions with this bridge during startup. Plugins are
then provided with an instance of the `PluginAPI` class, which grants dynamic,
safe, and version-agnostic access to these registered functions. It also
facilitates inter-plugin communication through a custom event system.
