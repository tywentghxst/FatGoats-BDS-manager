# bedrock_server_manager/plugins/plugin_base.py
"""Defines the abstract base class (ABC) for all plugins.

This module provides the :class:`.PluginBase` class, which serves as the
foundational template for all plugins within the Bedrock Server Manager
ecosystem. Plugins must inherit from this class to be recognized and loaded
by the :class:`~bedrock_server_manager.plugins.plugin_manager.PluginManager`.

By overriding the various event hook methods defined in this base class
(e.g., ``on_load``, ``before_server_start``), plugins can subscribe to and
react to specific events triggered by the core application or other parts
of the server manager.

class PluginBase(ABC):
    """The abstract base class (ABC) from which all plugins must inherit.

    Plugins should subclass :class:`.PluginBase` and **must** define a class
    attribute named ``version`` (e.g., ``version = "1.0.0"``). This version string
    is used by the :class:`~bedrock_server_manager.plugins.plugin_manager.PluginManager`
    for metadata and potential compatibility checks.

    Instances of concrete plugin subclasses are provided with the following
    attributes by the :class:`~bedrock_server_manager.plugins.plugin_manager.PluginManager`
    during initialization:

    Attributes:
        name (str): The plugin's name, typically derived from its Python module
            filename (e.g., "my_plugin" for ``my_plugin.py``).
        api (:class:`~bedrock_server_manager.plugins.api_bridge.PluginAPI`): An instance
            of the API bridge, providing safe access to core application functions.
        logger (:class:`logging.Logger`): A pre-configured logger instance, specific
            to this plugin. Log messages will automatically include the plugin's name.
        version (str): The plugin's own version string, copied from its class attribute.

    Plugins implement their functionality by overriding the various ``on_*``,
    ``before_*``, and ``after_*`` event hook methods defined in this class. These
    methods are called by the
    :class:`~bedrock_server_manager.plugins.plugin_manager.PluginManager`
    when corresponding application events occur. If a plugin does not override a
    specific hook method, the default ``pass`` implementation in this base class
    is used, meaning the plugin will simply ignore that event.
    """

    # Class attribute: version
    # All plugins *must* override this class attribute with their specific version string.
    # Example: version = "1.2.3"
    # The PluginManager uses this for display and potentially for compatibility.
    # If not defined by a subclass, it will default to "N/A" during instantiation,
    # but the PluginManager's synchronization step enforces its presence for a plugin
    # to be considered valid and loadable.
