# bedrock_server_manager/api/player.py
"""Provides API functions for managing the central player database.

This module offers an interface to interact with the application's central
player database, typically stored in ``players.json``. It leverages the
:class:`~bedrock_server_manager.core.manager.BedrockServerManager`
to perform operations such as:

- Manually adding or updating player entries (gamertag and XUID) via
  :func:`~.add_players_manually_api`.
- Retrieving all known player entries from the database using
  :func:`~.get_all_known_players_api`.
- Discovering players by scanning server logs and updating the database via
  :func:`~.scan_and_update_player_db_api`.

These functions are exposed to the plugin system and provide a structured way
to manage player data globally across all server instances.
