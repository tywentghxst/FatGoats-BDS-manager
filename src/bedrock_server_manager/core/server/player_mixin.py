"""
Provides the :class:`.ServerPlayerMixin` for the
:class:`~.core.bedrock_server.BedrockServer` class.

This mixin is responsible for scanning a server's log files (typically
``server_output.txt``) to identify and extract player connection information.
Specifically, it looks for lines indicating a player connection to parse out
player gamertags and their corresponding XUIDs. This information can be used,
for example, to populate a player database or track server activity.

        This method reads the server's primary output log file (obtained via

        regular expression to find lines matching the standard Bedrock server
        message for player connections, which typically looks like:
        "Player connected: <Gamertag>, xuid: <XUID>".

        multiple connections by the same player within the log.

            in the log. Each dictionary has two keys:
