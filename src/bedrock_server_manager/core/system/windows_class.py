# bedrock_server_manager/core/system/windows_class.py
"""Provides Windows-specific implementations for system interactions.

This module includes functions for:

    - Starting the Bedrock server process directly in the foreground.
    - Managing a named pipe server for inter-process communication (IPC) to send
      commands to the running Bedrock server.
    - Handling OS signals for graceful shutdown of the foreground server.
    - Sending commands to the server via the named pipe.
    - Stopping the server process by PID.
    - Creating, managing, and deleting Windows Services to run the server in the
      background, which requires Administrator privileges.

It relies on the pywin32 package for named pipe and service
functionality.
