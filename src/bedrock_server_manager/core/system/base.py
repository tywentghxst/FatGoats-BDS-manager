# bedrock_server_manager/core/system/base.py
"""Provides base system utilities and foundational cross-platform functionalities.

This module contains a collection of essential system-level utilities that are
generally platform-agnostic or provide a common interface for operations that
might have platform-specific nuances handled elsewhere. It serves as a core
part of the system interaction layer.

Key functionalities include:

    - **Internet Connectivity**:
        - :func:`.check_internet_connectivity`: Verifies basic internet access.
    - **Filesystem Operations**:
        - :func:`.set_server_folder_permissions`: Sets appropriate permissions for
          server directories, with platform-aware logic.
        - :func:`.delete_path_robustly`: A utility for robustly deleting files
          or directories, handling potential read-only issues.
    - **Process Information**:
        - :func:`.is_server_running`: Checks if a Bedrock server process is active
          and verified, relying on :mod:`~.core.system.process`.
    - **Resource Monitoring**:
        - :class:`.ResourceMonitor`: A singleton class for monitoring CPU and
          memory usage of processes, requiring the ``psutil`` library.

Constants:
    - :const:`.PSUTIL_AVAILABLE`: Boolean indicating if ``psutil`` was imported,
      critical for :class:`.ResourceMonitor`.

Internal Helpers:
    - :func:`._handle_remove_readonly_onerror`: An error handler for ``shutil.rmtree``.
