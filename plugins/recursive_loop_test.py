# <PLUGIN_DIR>/recursive_loop_test.py
"""
Plugin to test the PluginManager's event re-entrancy guard.

Purpose:
This plugin is designed to intentionally create a scenario where plugin events
could lead to an infinite recursive loop if not for the PluginManager's
thread-local event stack protection.

Test Flow (A -> B -> A'):
1. Event A ('before_server_start'):
   - This plugin's `before_server_start` handler is called.
   - It then calls `self.api.backup_all()`.

2. Event B ('before_backup'):
   - The `self.api.backup_all()` call internally triggers the 'before_backup' event.
   - This plugin's `before_backup` handler is called.
   - It then attempts to call `self.api.start_server()` for the same server.

3. Event A' ('before_server_start' - Recursive Attempt):
   - The `self.api.start_server()` call from Event B would normally try to
     trigger the 'before_server_start' event again.
   - **Expected Behavior:** The PluginManager should detect that 'before_server_start'
     is already in the current thread's event stack and will *skip dispatching
     the event handlers* for this second, recursive attempt. The `api.start_server()`
     function itself will continue its execution (and might report "server already
     running" or attempt to start another instance depending on system state,
     which is separate from the event guard test).

What to look for in the logs:
- The "--- LOOP TEST ---" messages from this plugin.
- A DEBUG message from `bedrock_server_manager.plugins.plugin_manager` similar to:
  "Skipping recursive event trigger for 'before_server_start'."
- The "--- LOOP TEST (B): Recursive self.api.start_server() call completed..." message,
  indicating the API call didn't crash due to an event stack overflow.
