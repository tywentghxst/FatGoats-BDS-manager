Plugin: NestedDifferentServerStartPlugin

Purpose:
Tests the PluginManager's GRANULAR event re-entrancy guard.
Specifically, it verifies that if `before_server_start` for Server A triggers
a `start_server` call for a DIFFERENT Server B, the `before_server_start`
event handlers for Server B ARE correctly dispatched (not skipped).

Test Flow:
1. Initial Trigger:
   - Manually start a server (e.g., "server1") via CLI or Web UI.
   - This triggers `before_server_start` for "server1".

2. Event A (`before_server_start` for "server1"):
   - This plugin's `before_server_start` handler is invoked for "server1".
   - It logs this and then calls `self.api.start_server(server_name="server2", ...)`.
     (Ensure "server2" is a different, validly configured server name).

3. Event B (Expected `before_server_start` for "server2"):
   - The `self.api.start_server(server_name="server2")` call should trigger
     `before_server_start` for "server2".
   - **Expected Behavior (Granular Guard):** The PluginManager should generate a
     key like `('before_server_start', 'server2')`. This key should NOT match
     `('before_server_start', 'server1')` already on the stack.
     Thus, event handlers for `before_server_start` (including this plugin's)
     SHOULD be dispatched for "server2".

4. Verification:
   - This plugin's `before_server_start` handler will be called again, this
     time with `server_name="server2"`.
   - The plugin logs this second call, confirming the dispatch for Server B.
   - The handler for "server2" will not trigger further starts to keep the test simple.

Setup for Testing:
- Ensure you have at least two servers configured, e.g., "server1" and "server2".
- Place this plugin in your user plugin directory and ensure it's enabled.
- Set logging level for 'bedrock_server_manager.plugins.plugin_manager' to DEBUG.
- Start "server1" (e.g., `bsm server start server1`).

What to Look For in the Logs:
- Log messages from this plugin for both "server1" and "server2" within `before_server_start`.
- DEBUG logs from `PluginManager` showing:
  - `Dispatching standard event 'before_server_start' (key: ('before_server_start', 'server1')) ...`
  - Later, inside that, `Dispatching standard event 'before_server_start' (key: ('before_server_start', 'server2')) ...`
  - Crucially, NO "Skipping recursive trigger..." message for the "server2" event.
